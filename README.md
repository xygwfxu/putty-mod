# putty-mod

The following changes have been made to putty base on 0.78.
* Use session name to windows tile when session is closed(dismiss close warning dialogbox as well) so we can know which session we used.
* Remember user name/password in memory so we can reconnect it without inputing such info again.
* Register Alt+F3 to reconnect session.
* By default enable alt+space option to invoke context menu so user can use #8 feature.
* When alt+enter option is disabled and user do alt+enter hotkey, the title&board&scrollbar will be hidden with max windows for monitor sth in small window.
* no more.
